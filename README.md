🗄️ Database

FoodRush uses MySQL as its backend database.

The database manages information related to:

Users
Food categories
Food items
Orders
Order items
Wishlist
Coupons
Ratings
Payments

The Flask backend connects to MySQL to retrieve and update application data.

📊 Power BI Dashboard

FoodRush includes a Power BI dashboard for analyzing food-ordering data.

The dashboard provides a business analytics layer on top of the application database.

Analytics Areas

The dashboard can be used to analyze:

Sales performance
Order trends
Customer activity
Food-item performance
Category performance
Business KPIs
Power BI File
FoodRush - Dashboard.pbix

Open the .pbix file using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Prerequisites

Install the following:

Python 3.x
MySQL Server
MySQL Workbench
Microsoft Power BI Desktop
2. Clone the Repository
git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL

Move into the project directory:

cd FoodRush-Food-Ordering-System
3. Install Python Dependencies

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure MySQL

Make sure MySQL Server is running.

Import the provided SQL file:

data_sql.sql

using MySQL Workbench or the MySQL command line.

5. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project directory.

Add your local MySQL configuration:

MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=zomato
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

Replace the values with your own local configuration.

Important: Never upload .env to GitHub because it can contain passwords and secret keys.

6. Run the Application

Start the Flask application:

python app.py

The application will run locally at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

🔐 Security

Sensitive configuration values are stored using environment variables.

The following information should never be published in a public repository:

MySQL passwords
Flask secret keys
API keys
Private credentials
Real customer information
Real payment credentials

The .gitignore file is used to prevent sensitive files such as .env from being uploaded.
